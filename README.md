# Social Buzz
Social Buzz is a Social Media and Content Creation (2008) with Over 500 million active users. They have 250 employee, 200 tech employee
They require external expertise for 3 reasons:  Looking to go on IPO - Small company - Learn data practises from large company.
# Problem Statement
The major task was to analyze sample data sets and visualize the popularity of different social media content categories. 
The client provided seven data sets with various columns. The data has some problems: 
Unstructured Data                     
Not Much Clean Data
Large Data Set     
Higher Number of Variables
# Goal
The ultimate goal was to find the most populer contents, demographical analysis of the Social Buzz users. And answering the following questions:
How many unique categories are there?
How many reactions are there to the most popular category?
What was the month with most posts?
How do people feel about the content?
To show the analysis a Power BI dashboard had been developed. 
# The Data
There were three excel file of the Reaction, Content, and Reaction Types data sets. Other four data sets include content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score.
# Data Modeling and Cleaning
The data cleaning steps were: 
Removing unnecessary columns 
Fixing wrong data types
Format Correction of the parameters
Removing empty values from the column
Numerical data imputation
After cleaning the data were modeled in the following format.
